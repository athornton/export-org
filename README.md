# export-org

This is a Dockerfile and some scripts (based on
https://gitlab.com/olberger/docker-org-teaching-export ) to allow you to
take an Emacs org-mode document and export it as Reveal.js or PDF.

Since I prefer writing my presentations in org-mode, and I think
Reveal.js is at least as nice as any of the slide presentation software
I know, this makes it very easy to go from an outline to a polished
presentation very quickly.
